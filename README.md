A simple and lightweight Chrome extension that enables a dark theme on any website. Designed especially to work well with dynamic sites like GitHub.

## 🔧 How It Works

- When enabled, the extension:
  - Applies the `my-dark-theme` class to `body` and key elements (`div`, `span`, `a`, etc.)
  - Adds dark background and light text via injected CSS
  - Removes GitHub-specific overlay classes like `color-bg-overlay`
